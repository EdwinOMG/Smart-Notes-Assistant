Researched OCR

Created a basic front end and back end to test ocr and upload features (not uploaded to repo)

Tested different options such as tesseract and google cloud vision, leading to decision to use google cloud vision.

Tesseract proved capable of handling digital notes, however, could not properly extract handwritten notes. Tesseract also runs locally.

Google Cloud Vision performed well with only minor hiccups. An ai model to structure extracted text and fix grammar needed.
